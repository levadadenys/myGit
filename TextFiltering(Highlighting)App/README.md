This is a simple interface that shows a block of text with very basic formatting.
The steps include:
•	We must fetch some dummy text from the server and query if there are existing tags associated with the text.
•	If tags already exist then the tags must be highlighted.
•	In order the add a tag the following functionality is required:
    o	User must have ability to click on a word.
    o	When a word is clicked:
    o	Similar words are selected.
▪	When the addition button is clicked, the word are set as a tag and saved to the 
    server.
